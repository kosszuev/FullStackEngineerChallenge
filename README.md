I used "VueJS" and "Tailwind CSS" to create this project.

There are 2 modes: Employee and Admin. You can switch between them, using tabs on the right top corner of the screen.

### Employee Mode

Using Employee mode, you can access any profile of existing employees. 

On the profile page of an employee, you can see a list of review requests, assigned to this particular employee if any.

Employee can access any review request pages, he/she is assigned to and leave a comment on that review request.

### Admin Mode
Using Admin mode, you can access, create, update, delete account of any existing employee.
